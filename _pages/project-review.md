  Project review for HIST 4261/5261: Working With Data
---

This is my proposal for a project review. It was written on **{{ page.date }}** and falls under the category of: {{ page.category }}. 
I would like to analyze the [NYPD crime statistics for 2000-2023](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/historical.page). They have charts with seven major felonies, non-major felonies, misdemeanors, and violations. Some of these charts use colors and footnotes, but for the most part they are pretty straightforward. It is easy to see that crime is generally lessening in NYC. As far as I can tell they are directly citing their own data, compiled from the NYPD register.
