  Project review for HIST 4261/5261: Working With Data
---

This is my project review. It was written on **{{ page.date }}** and falls under the category of: {{ page.category }}. 
I would like to analyze the [NYPD crime statistics for 2000-2023](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/historical.page). They have charts with seven major felonies, non-major felonies, misdemeanors, and violations. 


##ARGUMENT / INTERPRETATION- what is their interpretative point of view? How effectively is it communicated? 
Since it is an official government website, they attempt to remain impartial in the written aspects of the page. implicitly, however, it is obvious that crime overall has decreased in the city by about 20,000 instances across all four categories. Something helpful that adds context are the footnotes which detail the kinds of specific crimes that fall under the more broad categories in the tables. There are highlighted categories with the explanation that they “represent categories where a substantial portion of the complaint counts are generated as a result of the implementation of pro-active policing strategies” which seems to imply that the rest of the categories are not crimes that police seek out. It is also completely unclear when the ‘implementation’ began and overall unclear what point is supposedly being made by highlighting the rows. 

##DATA / EVIDENCE- What is the underlying dataset? How well do the project’s authors use that data? How does that data fit with other kinds of evidence?
NYPD has direct access to their database of crimes, so it is as complete of a record as there could be. They explain the counting process on the homepage; classifying and ’scoring’ the crimes based on the type and then the severity of the offense. They also state that in some cases attempted crimes count as a recorded crime, like attempted murder being recorded as a felony assault. The violation offenses are interesting because there are only two categories; harassment and everything else, and yet harassment is still the most common violation by a very large margin. The data is used pretty well, as it covers basically the complete range of crimes from felonies to violations.  As mentioned before, the footnotes are helpful to add context to the data, giving an idea of the actualities of the crimes. 

##ORGANIZATION / DESIGN- clear? Effective organization? Easy to navigate? What sort of design decisions did they make / how well do they work?
They chose to only use tables, which isn’t the worst organization ever, and it works surprisingly well here as you are able to follow one crime along a row through the years. Comparing the oldest and newest numbers is quickly doable. Keeping all four tables on entirely different web pages makes it more difficult to compare them against each other. The decision to use a color to highlight specific rows does well to make them stand out, and is accessible to colorblind people as well, but it doesn’t do much to communicate why those rows are important. I believe using graphs in tangent with the graphs would have added a lot, like making it easier to visualize trends in individual rows, and also to make the middle of the larger tables more interpretable. 

##COMMUNICATION / AUDIENCE- argument + evidence clearly communicated? Does it have a clear audience? How well does it address their needs?
There is not much of an argument, but the evidence is communicated fairly well, even if it is very basic. The addition of the highlighted rows for “pro-active policing strategies” implies that there is some significance to this, but it is not clear exactly what that is. My best guess would be that they believe these categories to be inflated because the police are actively looking for them.This kind of data is definitely relevant to different researchers like statisticians and even psychologists or anthropologists studying crime in cities. However, making it available publicly allows anyone curious in the subject to investigate the data. It seems particularly relevant nowadays with the more sensationalist & reactive media.
